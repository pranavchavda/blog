      <description>&lt;p&gt;Grinding your beans fresh is a must when making espresso. Once ground, coffee will quickly oxidize, stale, and cease to produce the desired flavor profile. Combine top quality beans with a good burr grinder and you&amp;rsquo;ll never have to drink a bad cup of coffee again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, lets go into detail about why selecting the right grinder is the first and possibly most important step towards consistently brewing great espresso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with pre-ground coffee?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good grinders are expensive. They are also an additional piece of equipment to care for. New espresso machine buyers may get tempted to skip the investment in a grinder and opt to buy pre-ground coffee. For espresso, which is all about consistent but tiny particulates, pre-ground is not an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee begins to stale as soon as it&amp;rsquo;s ground. The surface area of the coffee increases upon grinding and reacts with air and moisture in the air. Even if you buy whole beans there is a freshness window; with ground coffee, this window is much smaller - minutes, if not seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that makes you think about the blade grinder you already own, Sorry! it just won&amp;rsquo;t do. Not only will the teeth of the blade grind down the coffee beans unnecessarily severely, but the resulting grounds will also not be of consistent in size and shape. A blade grinder will also heat the coffee up as it grinds, and thus &amp;lsquo;cook&amp;rsquo; it, changing it&amp;rsquo;s flavour profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you want is a brand new burr grinder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does a burr grinder work? by &amp;lsquo;crushing&amp;rsquo; the coffee beans between two grooved surfaces as one surface remains stationary and the other one spins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This offers a very uniform grind and allows you the ability to customize your grinds very precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that we have established that burr grinders offer much better consistency than blade grinders, produce less heat and are able to produce more uniform grounds, lets talk about the two main types of burrs (or grinding discs, if you will), that burr grinders use. A burr grinder will be equipped with either a conical or a flat burr set. Whether or not one is better at grinding than the other is subject of much debate. It is however, certainly true that the same coffee will taste different depending on the type of burrs used to grind it; everything else being the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conical burrs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many entry-level grinders, almost all manual grinders and some very high end grinders use a conical burr set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://cremaontop.com/images/image-1.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Conical Burrs&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conical burrs consist of two parts, a cone shaped burr is surrounded by a ring and the coffee is ground or &amp;lsquo;crushed&amp;rsquo; in the space in between these two parts. The sharpness and overall geometry of the ridges on these burrs can make their host grinders either great for brewing espresso or specialize in grinding for manual brew methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flat burrs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://cremaontop.com/images/image-2.webp&#34;
         alt=&#34;Flat burrs&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Flat burrs&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most espresso focused grinders come with a flat burr set. Unlike conical burrs, they are two metallic discs of the same size, one on top of the other. The space between the upper and lower disc determines the fineness of your ground coffee. Like conical burrs, the sharpness and geometry of flat burrs can either favour espresso fineness or make them more suitable for grinding coffee meant to be brewed manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on who you talk to, some people say conical burrs need to be dialed in much more than flat burrs (well, I say that, but I also ready someone else write the exact opposite of it!). Flat burrs might have a tendency of retaining more coffee, this is probably why some single dosing grinders use conical burrs; there are also several higher-end single dose grinders that use flat burrs however, and they are known to retain very little ground coffee if any at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury is still out on the advantages of conical vs flat burrs for espresso, if you can, try both, and see which one you like best, if you are buying and have to choose one, I&amp;rsquo;d go with a flat burr grinder, they are more ubiquitous with mid to higher-end espresso grinders and in my experience they are more forgiving than conical burr grinders which require dialing in your grind much more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialing in your grind size&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per conventional wisdom, a &amp;lsquo;correct&amp;rsquo; espresso shot is when 18 grams of ground coffee goes into an espresso machine&amp;rsquo;s portafilter and 36 grams of liquid coffee out of it in 20 - 30 seconds. Modern espresso brewing has evolved beyond this way of thinking; especially with the advent of pressure profiling and flow control in espresso machines. You create a brew according to your taste and preferences, when happy with what you made, that is the perfect shot of espresso. The basic principle however, is still the same. A certain amount of grounds go in,  water from the espresso machine flows through them at a certain pressure for a determined period and a certain amount of brewed coffee is outputted - all of these variables are to be dialed in, and grind uniformity and size are essential for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perfect grinder for espresso will offer precise control grind size and thereby offer the most consistent and repeatable output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several other factors that go into selecting the perfect espresso grinder for your home espresso set-up. The above was only an overview. Over several future posts, I hope to into more nuance about various aspects of fine tuning your espresso grind. To conclude, I will say this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy freshly roasted whole bean coffee, never pre-ground&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay away from blade grinders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good espresso shot is subjective, but it can&amp;rsquo;t be brewed without an objectively good grinder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A grinder is a critical part of any home espresso set-up; get the right one and you will experience a much higher quality of espresso.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Iced Espresso: Your new favourite summer beverage.</title>
      <link>http://cremaontop.com/iced-espresso-the-best-drink-you-will-have-this-summer/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Jun 2021 15:32:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://cremaontop.com/iced-espresso-the-best-drink-you-will-have-this-summer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Iced espresso is the perfect drink for beating summer&amp;rsquo;s heat. When you&amp;rsquo;re looking for an uplifting drink and a cup of good ole&#39; coffee just feels wrong under the scorching sun, try an iced espresso, or an iced americano, if you are in the mood for a bigger glass of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Espresso&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Lemon wedge (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Espresso Machine,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cocktail Shaker,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cups,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ice Cubes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recipe:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pull a shot of espresso and pour it into a cocktail shaker with 2 cubes of ice. Mix, shake until the ice melts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pour into a chilled glass and serve with a slice(s) of lemon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make an iced americano. follow the above recipe and add cold water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use good quality coffee. The better the beans, the better the taste. I prefer lighter roasts and fruity beans, but that is subjective. What isn&amp;rsquo;t subjective is that freshly roasted (and certainly feshly ground) beans have no substitute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re making ice cubes at home, use distilled or filtered water, as this will create cleaner tasting ice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>How to Brew Good Espresso At Home - Part 1, the machine.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the right espresso machine and grinder, making a cafe-quality espresso at home is easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A good cup of) Espresso is sometimes seen as a glamorous drink only served in specialty coffee shops, but it is actually quite easy to make at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Espresso machines range from simple and cheap to complicated and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quality espresso machine, with the help of a good grinder will brew espresso with a rich, syrupy texture as well as the perfect balance of flavor and body.  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be expensive. Although some of the ones on the higher end tend to produce great results, Pairing a great grinder can turn a cheaper, more entry-level machine into something that can consistently produce coffee that is the envy of your neighborhood cafe&amp;rsquo;s baristas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to select what the right pair of espresso machine and grinder is for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a beginner or you are intimidated by experimentation and new technology, select a super automatic espresso machine.Superautomatics usually come with a built in grinder; you just put in fresh beans, press a button or two and voila! a decent shot of espresso is ready for consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most superautomatics will let you tweak grind size and other settings to try and produce better coffee. With superautomatics, there is a very small learning curve and you will be brewing good (but maybe not great) espresso at home in no time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, that&amp;rsquo;s out of the way, now lets say you are a serious coffee drinker who wants to pull shot after shot of the best espresso you have ever had, and you want to do that at home. You will want a manual/automatic espresso machine. We&amp;rsquo;ll split your options among these into two categories, depending on whether you enjoy pure shots of unadulterated espresso, or you enjoy your coffee as lattes, cappuccinos or other milk-based drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the straight up espresso lover, the choice is easy, get a single boiler espresso machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://cremaontop.com/images/IMG_20181017_233647.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;Americano? A single boiler is everything you need.&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Americano? A single boiler is everything you need.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you want to look for one that offers the best possible temperature stability -  A stable temperature ensures even extraction and results in a rich, flavorful espresso. When your machine can not maintain temperature stability, it will result in either under-extracted - watery, acidic coffee or over-extracted - bitter, dull and flavourless coffee that sometimes tastes burnt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single boiler machines can usually also steam milk, but you have to switch the boiler to steaming mode after brewing coffee, wait for it to get up to temperature, it is a hassle - so we&amp;rsquo;d recommend a single boiler for those who like their espresso shots and occasional americanos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like lattes or cappuccinos, you may want to consider a dual boiler machine or a heat exchange espresso machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://cremaontop.com/images/pouring-some-latte-art-1.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;Love latte, latte art? Dual Boiler or HX machines are the way to go.&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Love latte, latte art? Dual Boiler or HX machines are the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dual boiler machines have two boilers, you get both a boiler for steam and a separate one for espresso brewing. Dual boiler machines are capable of brewing espresso and steaming milk at the same time. Heat exchange (HX) machines can also brew and steam at the same time. While they come with just one boiler, it is calibrated for steaming milk, a tube which passes through this boiler, carries fresh water which gets heated up to brewing temperature as it reaches the brew-group. Heat exchange machines aren&amp;rsquo;t as temperature stable as dual boiler ones, but with practice, you can learn &amp;lsquo;flush&amp;rsquo; the brew group just the right amount before starting to brew your coffee to get the perfect brewing temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it, three types of machines to consider - Single boiler, dual boiler, and heat exchangers for those serious about home espresso brewing and superautomatics for people just wanting a good cup of joe at the press of a button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above is only part of the whole, for part 2 , we will cover the other, and arguably more important half of home espresso - choosing a grinder that matches your espresso machine.&lt;/p&gt;
