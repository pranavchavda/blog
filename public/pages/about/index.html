		<p>My name is Pranav and I am currently the sole author of this blog.</p>
<p>My passion for home espresso brewing started several years ago, around the same time as I started my job at a company that retails equipment and roasts coffee. Everyone there is passionate about coffee, and why not? coffee is amazing!</p>
<p>Now, After years of home espresso brewing, I decided to start this blog so I can share my passion about espresso with the world, as I continue to experiment with it and learn how to make great coffee.</p>
<p>I started off with a fairly simple goal: to document my journey as I work towards brewing the best coffee I have tasted. My aim with this blog is just that, and to inspire everyone who comes across it to brew their own coffee at home, no matter how small or big your kitchen might be.</p>
<p>Espresso brewing is an artful pursuit can can be extremely rewarding. If you are here, you already know that.</p>
<p>As a policy, you will find no advertising or affiliate links, etc on this website. If you come across any product review or recommendation, know that it is 100% my own opinion, and I am not being paid to blog here; either directly or through advertising.</p>
