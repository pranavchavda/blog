My name is Pranav and I am currently the sole author of this blog, with a little help from an AI.

My passion for home espresso brewing started several years ago, around the same time as I started my job at a company that retails equipment and roasts coffee. Everyone there is passionate about coffee, and why not? coffee is amazing! Brewing your own coffee can be, and quite possibly is as addictive as the beverage itself, if not more so.

Nearly a decade ago, I used to blog about several other topics. While I have wanted to start a new blog for a long time now, possibly with age and because of it, It is nearly impossible to find the time to do so.

I recently discovered something called GPT-3; a text generation AI developed by OpenAI which is entirely amazing.

With coffee always on my mind lately, and armed with this new discovery, I decided to employ this AI in conjunction with my passion for this beverage and my desire to get back into blogging.  Once you get a hang of it, it is incredible how well the AI can translate your own thoughts into almost publishable words.

With this blog I aim to document my journey as I work towards brewing the best coffee I have tasted and to inspire everyone who comes across it to brew their own coffee at home.  If you are into or are planning to get into home espresso brewing, feel free to subscribe! I can be reached via email on pranav [at] pranav [dot] email and appreciate feedback, suggestions and ideas from fellow espresso aficionados.
