Iced espresso is the perfect drink for beating summer's heat. When you're looking for an uplifting drink and a cup of good ole' coffee just feels wrong under the scorching sun, try an iced espresso, or an iced americano, if you are in the mood for a bigger glass of coffee.

**Ingredients:**

* Espresso
* Ice
* Water (optional)
* A Lemon wedge (optional)

**Tools:**

* Espresso Machine,
* Cocktail Shaker,
* Cups,
* Ice Cubes.

**Recipe:**

Pull a shot of espresso and pour it into a cocktail shaker with 2 cubes of ice. Mix, shake until the ice melts.

Pour into a chilled glass and serve with a slice(s) of lemon.

To make an iced americano. follow the above recipe and add cold water.

**Tips:**

* Use good quality coffee. The better the beans, the better the taste. I prefer lighter roasts and fruity beans, but that is subjective. What isn't subjective is that freshly roasted (and certainly feshly ground) beans have no substitute.
* If you're making ice cubes at home, use distilled or filtered water, as this will create cleaner tasting ice.
